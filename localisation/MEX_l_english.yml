 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico stands at the closing days of the Maximato, the period when former president Plutarco Elias Calles held the true power in Mexico using right wing loyalists in both politics and the military. Since 1934, Lázaro Cárdenas del Río has waged a political war to end Plutarco's control over the country and enact his own left wing reforms. Mexico stands at a crossroads while the world prepares for war, as the left wing and right wing battle over control of the country's future and where it stands in the coming new world order."
 MEX_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Maximato has ended and Calles is gone, but the battle between the left and right wings is still raging on. Emboldened by the economic hardship caused by the PEMEX embargoes, the right wing have become polarized and now exist in a state of political civil war over who will become the right wing candidate for the presidency next year. The dominant PRI however now rests at a choice between compromising their ideals with the moderate candidate Camacho or double down on the left wing candidate Mugica."
 # Biographies
 POLITICS_DIONISIO_ENCINA_DESC:0 "Dionisio was described as a polarizing figure, and historians were often found to have very little positive things to say about his leadership. Dionisio was responsible for the fracturing of the largest Mexican communist party, the PCM. He was backed by Soviet agents in charge of spreading communism in Mexico and never acted unless ordered to, and feared that his Soviet handlers would find a more suitable leader for the PCM. This fear caused him to purge anyone who had better leadership skills or charisma from the PCM out of fear that he would be replaced by them, leaving the PCM with a severe lack of good leadership and proactive thinking."

  mexico.31.d:0 "UK diplomats are outraged and call for us to arrest William Jenkins for violating Article 30 of the constitution. They accuse him of tampering with Mexican politics by using his media monopoly to turn Mexicans against the United Kingdom. However, our sources say that Jenkins is merely refusing to publish most anti-German films in Mexico,with recent events backing the prudent move. The previous film published was "The Lion has Wings", a movie about the RAF raid on the Kiel Canal, drew such anger that Mexican cinemas were forced to remove the movie. William Jenkins, as far as we know, did nothing expressly wrong if pro-UK films were unpopular with Mexcian audiences. This situation could also be used to expel more than just Jenkins or the English, we would have an excuse to expel all of the lawbreakers in the nation to save face as we would not be laying blame on any one party. What should we do?"

  mexico.32.d:0 "UK diplomats are outraged and call for us to arrest William Jenkins for violating Article 30 of the constitution. They accuse him of tampering with Mexican politics by using his media monopoly to turn Mexicans against the United Kingdom. However the DFS says that Jenkins is linked to Maximino Camacho, and is protecting Jenkins politically in exchange for business opportunities. Maximino is a known axis sympathizer, and is said to have a photo of Mussolini hanging over his bed at his masnion in Pueblo. It is obvious that Maximino is using his leverage over Jenkins to stop non-fascist influence from gaining a foothold in Mexico. Pro-UK movies however are extremely unpopular with Mexican audiences and prompted Mexican cinemas to stop showing them in some instances. The decision to allow pro-UK movies would please the United Kingdom, but not the Mexican movie goer. This situation could also be used to expel more than just Jenkins or the English, we would have an excuse to expel all of the lawbreakers in the nation to save face as we would not be laying blame on any one party.

  mexico.35.t:0 "Report: Dioniso Encinia"
  mexico.35.d:0 "The PCM, from its inception, was created and funded by Soviet Russia. Dioniso is a Soviet puppet, and his presence is divisive. The PCM has splintered into many opposing communist parties entirely due to Dioniso's insecurity, purging members who might threaten his seat as the leader. Dioniso is entirely dependent on Soviet guidance, and the advice of his much more capable wife. A PCM led Mexico would be disastrous, not only creating a false government and puppet state but filling it with intentionally inept leadership. Currently, relations with the Soviets have remained nonexistent after the failed Soviet-backed coup in 1929, and the outlawing and dismantling of the PCM in the following years. They are however now growing as communist support is surging in Mexico. We cannot stop the rise of communism, but we can stop who will lead it. The attempted assassionation..."

  ## ELECTION UPDATE ##

  mexico.38.t:0 "PRI Candidate"
  mexico.38.d:0 "The election is drawing closer, and we must put forward a candidate to campaign for the PRI against the right wing. Currently, there are two possible candidates. Fransisco Mugica is left wing, and more aligned with socialist ideals. Choosing Mugica would be a risk if popularity for socialist ideals are low. Manuel Ávila Camacho is the more centrist choice, and is more accepted by the right wing. However, choosing Camacho would stop any hope of left wing reforms passing."
  mexico.38.a:0 "Choose Fransisco Mugica to run for president. (Communist choice)"
  mexico.38.b:0 "Choose Manuel Ávila Camacho to run for president. (Neutral choice)"
  
  mexico.39.t:0 "Right Wing Candidate"
  mexico.39.d:0 "The right wing is currently in a civil war between Juan Andreu Almazán and Joaquin Amaro over who should be the presidential candidate. Almazán is known more for being a noted businessman rather than a military figure, and draws in support mainly from wealthy Mexicans. However, his support among the working poor is abysmal as he is seen as offering nothing to them. Almazán's foreign policy is noticeably pro-US and further alianates average Mexicans. Amaro however is a famous military figure, and draws respect from the nationalists. Despite this, Almazán is seen as the inevitable choice for the right wing candidacy and Amaro's bid is quickly losing support to Almazán's campaign through a series of high profile defections. It is clear that Amaro will inevitably lose as Juan is backed by US interests and people find voting for a candidate that the US would try to overthrow is a fool's errand. However, there are people among the fascist cabal in Mexican politics who want to ensure that Almazán never lives to see election day. Maximino Ávila Camacho, brother to Manuel Ávila Camacho, has devised a plan to assassinate Juan Almazán at Plueba by staging an train accident."

  mexico.40.d:0 "Juan Almazán, the front runner to become the right wing presidential candidate has died in a train derailment in Plueba killing all those aboard. Almazán, a controversial figure, is no stranger to assassination attempts and has had multiple attempts on his life during the presidential campaign. His supporters have accused the PRI itself of orchestrating the derailment. Previously, Almazán was attacked by assassins wearing sarapes that hid machine guns while staying at the house of Fransisco Barbosa. His campaign claims he was attacked by an army of 100 assassins, and that he had to be stopped from running outside to fight them. Former general Alfredo Serratos however stated in an interview there were only 5 assassins."
